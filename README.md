Made a simple app using the guidlines in the project description.

A two screen App which has a table in the first View and a Y = m*X+c line equation  function graph in the second view.

Added table list of books which has an image and author name  and the title of the book in a customizable cell.


First uses a custom cell with NSMutable arr of books data and a simple table is created with the UIView.

In the second view the View is of 300 * 300 and two sliders which each changing m and c values respectively.

In the view CGContext is used to create a axis and a line is draw from center of the axis to a point.

the m value changes the equation y = m*x + c
the c changes the y intercept of the line

A  button is used to double the m value when passed by the slider and the n again changes it in the view calling the Networker class
